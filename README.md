# What's Cookin Refactor Tractor
 Mod2 Group Project

The idea behind this project was to be able to step into a half finished repository and take control in an organized fashion. Our main focus was to organize a very unorganized codebase, while also learning to implement SCSS and Webpack in order to help make the repository more modular.

## Technologies and Skills

This application is made using:
  * Clean, semantic HTML5 and CSS3 / SCSS including media queries so that is can be viewed across a variety of screens.
  * ES6 Javascript, arrow functions, classes, and iterator methods.
  * Webpack for bundling and production build.
  * Mocha and Chai for our TDD tests.

Our main objectives were:

  * Separating the data model (using classes) and DOM model
  * Implementing helper functions to keep code clean and demonstrate DRYness and SRP.
  * Using SCSS mixins, nesting and extends to help DRY up CSS.
  * Using atomic commits and creating branches that reflect the current feature we worked on.
  * Setting up an efficient ticket / pull request format using GitHub.
  * Writing a robust testing suite that had happy and sad test paths.
  * Refactored to ensure user's accessibility.
